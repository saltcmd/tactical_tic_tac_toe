# Tactical Tic Tac Toe
A tool to win Ultimate Tic Tac Toe.  
Every year my friend and I play a game of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe and I lose. Not this year.

## How to Play
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is played on a big 3x3 grid, where each square contains a smaller Tic Tac Toe board. Players take turns placing their `X` or `O` on one of the squares in a smaller board. 

The twist is that wherever you play, you send your opponent to the corresponding smaller board for their next move. For example, if you place your mark in the **top-right square** of a small board, your opponent must play in the **top-right small board**. 

The goal is to win three smaller boards in a row on the big grid, just like regular Tic Tac Toe. If a small board is full or already won, the other player can choose any **open board** for their turn. Play continues until one player achieves three in a row on the larger grid or no moves remain.
